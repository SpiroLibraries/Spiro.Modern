Spiro.Modern
============

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/w5vgjhtym1kyd407)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/scascarini/spiro-modern-193)


Spiro.Modern is a complete 'generic' user interface that will work against any API that conforms to the Restful Objects standard. It makes use of the Spiro.Models and Spiro.Angular libraries.

Spiro.Modern adopts the 'modern' or 'flat' style of design  -  though, of course, its whole look and feel may be customised.

Spiro.Modern may be run as an SPA within a browser, or may easily be converted to run as a standalone Windows Store App on Windows 8.
